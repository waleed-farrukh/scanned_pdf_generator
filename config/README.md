# How to use the config

The config is written as a collection of different "variant" feature. Each element in the config is independent and can be turned on/off and adapted to make your specific variant.

For example, to turn off motion blur, change the apply to false. If you want to turn the perspective distortion on, change the apply to true.

Have fun creating different variants!
