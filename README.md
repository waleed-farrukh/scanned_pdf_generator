# Scanned Variant Generator


This tool converts a PDF or an image of a document into a scanned or mobile-caputured variant.

Note: This tool is an existing project developed for internal use in middle of 2018. It has since then not been updated.
I decided to make it open source since I found it quite handy.
This is my first github upload. I will follow up with more internally-developed and new projects soon!
